## 🛠️ Built With

![Tools](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,js,git,github)


## 📜 Constraints

1. `rock`, `paper`, & `scissors` are the only game inputs allowed.
1. Cheating attempt is an automatic `failure`.
2. You win the game if you reach the score of `5` before your opponent.
3. Play input is case-insensitive, meaning, `rock` == `ROCK` == `Rock`.


## 🎬 Scenarios

1. **TIE**: A play round is `Tied` when both players draw the same inputs. For example, `rock`+`rock`, `scissors`+`scissors`, or `paper`+`paper`.

2. **WIN**: A play round is `Won` when it draws `rock`+`scissors`, `paper`+`rock`, or `scissors`+`paper`, respectively to `player`+`computer`

3. **LOST**: A play round is `Lost` when both scenarios `1` & `2` fail.


## 🙋 Let's play

1. From the three `Play buttons` (`rock`<>`fist`, `paper`<>`hand`, `scissor`<>`Two fingers`), select one which best suits your choice. You should be able to see the result of the play round and the current game score, just above the `Play buttons` belt.
2. Repeat step `1` until the game is concluded.
3. Press the `Restart` button anytime you wish to reset the game.
